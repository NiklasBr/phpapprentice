// Now that we know how to create variables, let's look at doing some math.
$a = 1;
$b = 2;

// To add two values, use the plus symbol.
$c = $a + $b;

// To subtract, use the minus symbol.
$c = $b - $a;

// To multiply two values, use an asterisk.
echo $a * $b;

// To divide values, use a forward slash.
echo $b / $a;

// PHP uses the percent symbol for calculating the modulus of two numbers.
// The modulus is calculated by dividing two numbers and returning the remainder of the result.
// So, in this example, the value of $modulo will be 0.
$modulo = 10 % 5;

// You can also use double asterisks to calculate a number to the power of another number.
// The following statement will print 25.
echo 5 ** 2;
