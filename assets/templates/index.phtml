            The goal of PHP Apprentice is to be an easy to understand resource for learning how to write good code in the PHP programming language. There are a lot of PHP tutorials on the internet that use outdated libraries, insecure programming practices or inefficient code. I want this site to show how to write PHP code with quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site currently has content for learning the basics of PHP. In the future, more pages will be added for more advanced topics like building websites, database integration and security.
