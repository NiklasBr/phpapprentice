            The goal of PHP Apprentice is to be an easy to understand resource for learning how to write good code in the PHP programming language. There are a lot of PHP tutorials on the internet that use outdated practices or insecure code. I want this site to show how to write PHP code with quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            PHP Apprentice is for beginners and for developers who already know some PHP. The site currently has content for learning the basics of PHP. In the future, more pages will be added for more advanced topics like building websites, database integration and security.
